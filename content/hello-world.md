# Hello World!

Welcome to my first blog post. This is a test post to demonstrate how Markdown is rendered.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write content in Markdown format
- **Code Highlighting**: Show code samples with syntax highlighting
- **Responsive Design**: Works great on all devices

## Code Example

Here's a simple Rust function:

```rust
fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}

fn main() {
    let greeting = greet("World");
    println!("{}", greeting);
}
```

## What's Next?

I'm planning to write more about:

1. Rust programming
2. Web development
3. System design
4. And more!

Stay tuned for more content coming soon.
