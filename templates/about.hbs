            Hello! I'm Andy, a developer with a passion for Rust, web development, and writing.
            This blog is my personal space to share thoughts, projects, and insights.

        <p>
            The site is built with Rust using the Actix-web framework and Handlebars templating.
            All blog posts are written in Markdown and parsed at build time.
